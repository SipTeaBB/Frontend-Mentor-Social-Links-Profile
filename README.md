## Overview

### The challenge

[Social links profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ/hub)

Create a simple html and css page that shows a users image, location,<br>
a quote and then lists their social media links below.

## My process

I started by placing all of the social media links into 
an
 ```html
<section></section>
```
then I placed each individual "link" into a sperate 
```html
<div></div>
```
after giving every element I wanted to style a class, from there it was much easier to begin making a stylesheet and implementing the 
changes I wanted.

### Built with


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I tend to style individual elements entirly rather than doing any global styles. I'm really trying to break that habbit.
I'm also getting better at usingg css pseudo-classes. 

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


I love that i got a chnance to play around with :hover
``` css
#sipteabb:hover, #frontendMentor:hover {
    text-decoration: underline wavy;
    color: var(--location-color);
    
}




### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
